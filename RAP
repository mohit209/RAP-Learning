# ABAP RAP — Daily Learning Checklist

## Days 1–3: RAP Fundamentals
- [ ] Day 1: Read RAP overview — what RAP is, why use RAP vs classic ABAP, RAP architecture (data-model, behavior, service layers).  
- [ ] Day 2: Go through “Get to Know RAP” tutorial (data modeling, business objects, service model, service consumption).  
- [ ] Day 3: Sketch a sample business scenario to model (e.g. Task manager, Order + Items, Book catalog).  

## Days 4–7: Setup & CDS / Data Modeling Basics
- [ ] Day 4: Set up development environment (ADT + ABAP system / BTP ABAP environment).  
- [ ] Day 5: Create a new ABAP package/workspace for RAP development.  
- [ ] Day 6: Define a simple database table (or reuse custom table) to back your future RAP BO.  
- [ ] Day 7: Write a simple CDS view on top of that table (fields + key + optionally simple associations).  

## Days 8–12: Business Objects & Behavior Definition
- [ ] Day 8: Learn how to define a Business Object (BO) in RAP, with behavior definition (CRUD, managed/unmanaged).  
- [ ] Day 9: Use RAP Wizard to “Generate ABAP Repository Objects” for your table for BO + service skeleton.  
- [ ] Day 10: Use managed implementation — let RAP handle CRUD; test basic create/read/update/delete.  
- [ ] Day 11: Read about behavior enhancements: validations, custom logic/actions, determinations.  
- [ ] Day 12: Add a small validation or business rule to your BO (e.g. mandatory field, simple logic) and test.  

## Days 13–16: Service Definition & OData Exposure
- [ ] Day 13: Define a service for your BO — create service definition + service binding to expose OData.  
- [ ] Day 14: Publish service and test GET (read) operations via OData / service preview.  
- [ ] Day 15: If CRUD enabled — test POST/PUT/DELETE (create, update, delete) via OData service or test tools.  
- [ ] Day 16: Reflect: trace data flow (CDS → BO → Service → OData), understand layer separation.  

## Days 17–21: Build Simple End-to-End RAP App
- [ ] Day 17: Pick your sample scenario (from Day 3), design data model/BO/service: e.g. Task manager, Book catalog.  
- [ ] Day 18: Implement data model (table + CDS) + BO + service for that scenario.  
- [ ] Day 19: Activate and review generated artifacts; ensure no structural errors.  
- [ ] Day 20: Test CRUD operations thoroughly via OData / service test — create, read, update, delete.  
- [ ] Day 21: (Optional) If possible — consume the OData service via Postman / browser / UI to test end-to-end.  

## Days 22–25: Annotations, UI Metadata & Behavior Enhancements
- [ ] Day 22: Learn about CDS/UI annotations — labels, metadata for fields, UI-relevant settings.  
- [ ] Day 23: Add UI-relevant annotations to your CDS / projection / consumption view.  
- [ ] Day 24: Add a custom action or business logic (e.g. status change, custom button/action) in BO behavior.  
- [ ] Day 25: Add additional logic — e.g. computed fields, default values, automatic timestamping, business-rule logic.  

## Days 26–29: Composite Modeling / Associations / Master-Detail
- [ ] Day 26: If scenario demands — add a second table/entity (child), design CDS association/composition (master-child).  
- [ ] Day 27: Define BO(s) for master + child, behavior definitions, service exposure for both.  
- [ ] Day 28: Activate, review generated artifacts — ensure associations/compositions are valid.  
- [ ] Day 29: Test CRUD on composite objects: create master with children, read master & children, update/delete, check associations.  

## Days 30–34: Testing, Error Handling & Robustness
- [ ] Day 30: Introduce invalid inputs (missing mandatory fields, invalid values) — test validations, error messages, rollbacks.  
- [ ] Day 31: Test edge cases: nulls, empty lists, max field lengths, etc. Ensure stable behaviour.  
- [ ] Day 32: Review code/design — naming, structure, maintainability, clarity. Refactor if needed.  
- [ ] Day 33: Add optional enhancements — default values, additional annotations/metadata, computed/sort fields if relevant.  
- [ ] Day 34: Document your model / project: write comments, README or spec, describe data model, BO, service.  

## Days 35–38: (Optional) Business Events & Advanced RAP Features
- [ ] Day 35: Read about business-event support in RAP (how to define and raise events in BO behavior)  
- [ ] Day 36: Try implementing a simple business event in your project (e.g. raise event when new record created)  
- [ ] Day 37: Test the event — ensure it’s raised correctly; optionally create a local event handler to consume it (if environment allows)  
- [ ] Day 38: Reflect — think about possible use-cases for events (notifications, integrations, async processing).  

## Days 39–44: (Optional) UI/Client Consumption or Service Consumption Testing
- [ ] Day 39: If you have front-end tools (or generic OData client) — build a simple UI or client to consume your OData service (list/detail, create, update).  
- [ ] Day 40: Test UI/client — ensure all CRUD actions work correctly via frontend or OData calls.  
- [ ] Day 41: Add UI enhancements via annotations or metadata (field labels, visibility, read-only flags, default values).  
- [ ] Day 42: Test validations/error handling via UI (if supported): e.g. mandatory fields, invalid inputs.  
- [ ] Day 43: Test end-to-end flow (UI → BO → DB) for all operations.  
- [ ] Day 44: Note down any issues / limitations; refine service/BO/data model if needed.  

## Days 45–50: Build a More Realistic Mini-Project / Prototype
- [ ] Day 45: Design a full project spec: 2–3 entities, associations, validations/business-rules, service endpoints.  
- [ ] Day 46: Implement data model (tables + CDS + associations), BO definitions, service definitions & bindings.  
- [ ] Day 47: Activate and review all generated artifacts (BOs, services, associations, CDS views).  
- [ ] Day 48: Expose services via OData (UI or Web API depending on need).  
- [ ] Day 49: Test thoroughly: CRUD, associations, business-rules, edge-cases, data integrity.  
- [ ] Day 50: Validate correctness, consistency, and behaviour under different scenarios.  

## Days 51–56: Clean-up, Review, Documentation & Reflection
- [ ] Day 51: Review project structure — packages, naming conventions, separation of layers (data vs behavior vs service).  
- [ ] Day 52: Add documentation: README/spec — how to setup project, explanation of entities/relations, business logic, service endpoints.  
- [ ] Day 53: If UI built — review UI behavior: labels, data display, CRUD flow, error-handling, user experience.  
- [ ] Day 54: Optionally add small enhancements: search/filter services, custom actions, extra validations, audit logging.  
- [ ] Day 55: Plan next steps: advanced RAP features, performance tuning, integration, UI5/Fiori, cloud deployment.  
- [ ] Day 56: Reflect on what you’ve learnt, write down key takeaways, list areas needing deeper learning (e.g. events, performance, complex scenarios, integration).
